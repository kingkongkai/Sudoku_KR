The implementation of this Sudoku solver is based on the paper:

    "A SAT-based Sudoku solver" by Tjark Weber

    https://www.lri.fr/~conchon/mpri/weber.pdf

If you want to understand the code below, in particular the function valid(),
which calculates the 324 clauses corresponding to 9 cells, you are strongly
encouraged to read the paper first.  The paper is very short, but contains
all necessary information.
